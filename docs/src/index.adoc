These projects are using the jxlint framework and demonstrate how static analysis tools can be written.

NOTE: TODO add additional linter examples

==== jxlint-impl

git-link:jxlint-impl/[jxlint-experiments/jxlint-impl (GitHub)] is copied from the link:https://github.com/selesse/jxlint[jxlint repository on GitHub].
It performs some checks on java files.

The modifications to the original project are tagged in the source code with a `<customized>...</customized>` section wrapped in java comments.
Have a look at git-link:jxlint-impl/src/main/java/com/selesse/jxlintimpl/Main.java[Main.java] for an example.

==== example-project-java

git-link:example-project-java/[jxlint-experiments/example-project-java (GitHub)] is a simple Java project containing a main class and a unit test class: `JavaExampleTest`.
This class contains on purpose some mistakes, that should be marked as error by the <<jxlint-impl>> linter.

The linter is started during the maven build, using the `org.codehaus.mojo:exec-maven-plugin` plugin.
Here is the corresponding configuration taken from the git-link:example-project-java/pom.xml[pom.xml] file:
